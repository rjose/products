WebSockets Module
=================
Rino Jose <@rjose>
v1, July 10, 2013: Initial version


Overview
--------
About a month ago, we
link:https://github.com/rjose/prototypes/tree/master/serve_ws[prototyped] a
number of areas related to websockets. What I'd like to do now is to use that
work to do TDD on a websockets module that we can use in apps like QPlan. We
should be able to integrate this into the "handle_request_routine". Somewhere
in that routine should be a call to check if the request is the start of a
websocket handshake (that's something that we'll need to implement here). If
so, it should try to establish a websocket connection; if not, it should
handle the HTTP request. All of this should happen within the same request
handling thread.

Once the connection is established, the thread will continue to run until the
connection is closed. We'll have to make sure we do this efficiently. If this
hasn't been prototyped properly, we should do so first.

We'll need some way to associate a websocket channel with something in the
app. For instance, one channel is publishing content to people in a meeting
while another channel is providing data to a hub app. We need to keep these
straight within each app.


Implementation
--------------
. Check if request is start of websocket handshake
. Complete websocket handshake (server)
. Construct short message
. Construct medium message
. Construct long message
. Read short message
. Read medium message
. Read long message
. Close channel
. Handle close channel
. Construct PING/PONG messages
. Read PING/PONG message

. Start websocket handshake (as a client)
. Complete websocket handshake (as a client)


1 - Check if request is start of websocket handshake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step is to get some initial empty tests to run. I'll copy what I did
for link:https://github.com/rjose/products/tree/master/algoc[algoc]. Done!
Now, let's get some HTTP request strings and see if we can tell if they're
websocket requests or not. I'll start with the first example in the spec.

Thoughts
--------
I think I'll symlink the websockets directory into the project that needs it
and compile everything into one executable.
